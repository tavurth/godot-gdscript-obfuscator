# Usage


This project was not really ready for production use and was more used as a way to show what might be possible.

The proposal to read if you find this repository interesting:
https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/4220

Please do not attempt to use this to mangle your project files üôè

## ‚Äº Use this at your own risk ‚Äº

This is very early work and this will mess up your game if you don&rsquo;t have a git backup.

Currently not production ready, built more as an example of what we could do for GDScript obfuscation

## Dependencies

This currently uses `pt` ([platinum-searcher](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher)) for quickly finding all of the references in the project.
In the future we will probably move this to pure python.

## Running the obfuscator

1.  Put this script in your game directory
2.  Ensure `DRY_RUN` is `True` at the top of the file (only `prints` changes)
3.  `python3 obfuscator.py`

## # no-mangle

Currently `# no-mangle` keyword is supported only for function names

    func my_function(): # no-mangle
    	pass

Which will keep the name of the function intact

# Support

Currently this is something that I will work on when I have some free time. If you like this project and want me to work on it more, consider buying me a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è
