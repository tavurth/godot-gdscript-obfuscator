#+TITLE: Godot GDScript Obfuscator

* Usage

** ‼ Use this at your own risk ‼

This is very early work and this will mess up your game if you don't have a git backup.

Currently not production ready, built more as an example of what we could do for GDScript obfuscation

** Dependencies

This currently uses ~pt~ ([[https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher][platinum-searcher]]) for quickly finding all of the references in the project.
In the future we will probably move this to pure python.

** Running the obfuscator

1. Put this script in your game directory
2. Ensure ~DRY_RUN~ is ~True~ at the top of the file (only ~prints~ changes)
3. ~python3 obfuscator.py~
